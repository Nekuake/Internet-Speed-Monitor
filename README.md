**Internet Speed Monitor**

## Deprecated and no longer mantained.

Several changes in Python since the initial release have made this program unusable. It may be easily fixable but I'm focused on other things. 

An utility that tests the internet connection periodically. It allows the user to determine which tests will be done, how many tests and how many seconds will pass between every test. 
The core has been written in Python 3, the GUI has been designed using Tkinter and the program uses the Sivel's speedtest API (Ookla).
