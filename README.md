**Internet Speed Monitor**


An utility that tests the internet connection periodically. It allows the user to determine which tests will be done, how many tests and how many seconds will pass between every test. 
The core has been written in Python 3, the GUI has been designed using Tkinter and the program uses the Sivel's speedtest API (Ookla).
